# Travel Expense Tracker Web Prototype

This repository contains a simple prototype for a travel expense tracker. It allows you to:

- Define participants for a trip
- Record expenses specifying the payer and amount
- View a basic summary of spending per participant

The prototype is implemented as a small web application located in the `web/` directory. Open `web/index.html` in a browser to test it.

The interface now features a minimalist Western style theme for clearer readability and a more polished look.

This is an early proof of concept meant for experimentation and does **not** include authentication or syncing with Google Sheets yet.
